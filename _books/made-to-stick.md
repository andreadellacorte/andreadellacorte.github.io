### Introduction

- Many of us struggle with how to communicate ideas effectively, how to get our ideas to make a difference.
- This book helps you make your ideas stick. By "stick" we mean that your ideas are understood and remembered, and have a lasting impact - they change your audience's opinions or behavior.
- This book's approach is different from the traditional methods, which focus on delivery, structure and repetition of the key message: this book focuses on the traits that make ideas sticky.
- The Curse of Knowledge it's what makes sharing our ideas so hard: once we know something, it's hard to identify with people who don't. Due to this, even the most important, revolutionary and brilliant ideas could seem impossible to communicate due to this unbalance, which makes it impossible to reach our audience.
- To beat the Curse of Knowledge, we can apply the following steps:
  1. Find the core idea by weeding out superfluous and tangential elements. Sharing the core idea helps people avoid bad decisions by reminding them of what's important in noisy, unpredictable, chaotic environments.
  2. Communicate the core idea to others effectively making sure our message meets the following six principles:
    - Simplicity: The core ideas must be prominent in our message, compactly expressed and so profound they could influence a lifetime of behaviour.
    - Unexpectedness: We must generate interest and curiosity. We need to violate people's expectations. We need to be counterintuitive.
    - Concreteness: We must explain our ideas in terms of human actions, in terms of sensory information.
    - Credibility: Sticky ideas have to carry their own credentials, simple enough for the audience to test it themselves and believe it.
    - Emotions: We must make people care by making them feel something by harnessing the right emotion.
    - Stories: We must tell stories to get people to act on our ideas, preparing them to act quickly and effectively.

### Simplicity

- Profound and compact ideas pack a lot of meaning into a small message. To do this we can tap into the existing memory schemas of our audience.
- Schemas are collections of generic properties of a concept or category. They consist of a lot of prerecorded information in our memories. By calling up schemas in our messages we can communicate concepts much faster than if we mechanically listed all the attributes of our ideas, improving on both their comprehension and the ability to recall them.
- Start with simple, stripped-down examples that can be easily understood with little context. Once the basic schema is established, we can stretch this schema along the desired dimensions.
- The use of "schemas" and analogies can seem a slower path to "real truth" (i.e. communicating our message in its completeness and with perfect accuracy), but they help us communicate our ideas in a useful way, avoiding the Curse of Knowledge.
- Good analogies are also "generative": they are platforms for novel thinking that generate "new perceptions, explanations, and inventions".

### Unexpected

- Mental schemas are like guessing machines, they help us predict what will happen and make good decisions.
- When they fail and the unexplainable happens we are surprised: the event jolts our attention, we pause and reflect, so that we can repair our machines.
- Stickier ideas seize this power by breaking people's mental schemas and then helping them repair them by providing insights related to their core message. The step by step process is:
  1. Identify the central messages;
  2. Figure out what's counter-intuitive about the message;
  3. Communicate the message in a way that breaks the audience's guessing machine along the counterintuitive dimension.
- Sticky ideas help us break the complacency of common sense and rewrite existing schemas in the mind of our audience. To make this work we need to know how people's schema are defective, swift the rug from underneath them with surprise, and then provide them powerful insights to help make their mental models better.
- Curiosity happens when we feel a gap in our knowledge; to sustain attention, we must feed people's curiosity with a steady stream of open questions: the desire to fill this gap in our knowledge will keep them interested.
- To convince people they need our message, we should henceforth first point out a specific piece of knwoledge they're missing.
