I recently migrated my website from AWS S3 to Github Page. I wanted an even simpler website than before. I chose to re-theme using the amazing [remarkdown](https://fvsch.github.io/remarkdown/) CSS stylesheet. I also decided to remove all javascript from the base template for my site. No more tracking or dynamic behavior on the majority of the pages. My reasoning for this: a blog should just be a simple website focused on content. Anything additional becomes a distraction. I have little time these days to manage the upkeep of a complex and overly engineered website.
