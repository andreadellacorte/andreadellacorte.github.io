### Scrum
- 3 Roles,
- 3 Ceremonies,
- 3 Artifacts,
- 3 Best Practices

### Scrum’s Three Roles

  - The Product Owner:
    - Defines and Prioritizes Features
    - Owns the gathering of requirements
    - Agrees to Iteration Ground Rules
    - Set length of calendar time for Sprint
      - (2,3,4 weeks typical)
    - Does not interfere with Sprint (no scope creep)
    - Can pull the plug at any time (has the power)
    - Honors rules and the Scrum process during Sprints
  - Scrum Master: A Boundary Manager
    - Supports the Team
    - Facilitates the Daily Scrum meeting. Asks each developer:
      - What did you do yesterday?
      - What are you doing today?
      - What is in your way?
    - Listens and watches carefully during Scrum meeting
      - Pays careful attention to non-verbal cues
      - Removes Impediments in Way of Team
    - Secures resources (monitors, rooms, etc)
    - Communicates to Product Owner
  - The Team:
    - Participates in design
      - To gain understanding of problem/solution space
    - Selects subset of prioritized Product Backlog for Sprint commitment
      - Estimates the effort
      - Fills the timebox with work
      - Commits to the work as a team
    - Self organizes:
      - Everyone commits to ALL TASKS necessary during the Sprint
      - Determines the nature of self-organization
    - Teams select work for each Sprint
      - Teams self-organize
      - Teams have a ‘velocity’

### Scrum’s Three Ceremonies
- Ceremony #1: Sprint Planning Meeting
  - Product Owner reviews:
    - Vision, Roadmap, Release Plan
  - Team reviews:
    - Estimates for each item on Backlog that is a candidate for the Sprint
    - Team pulls the work:
      - From the Product Backlog onto the Sprint Backlog
- Ceremony #2: The Daily Scrum
  - By and for the Team
  - Other may attend and NOT speak
  - Team members speak, others listen
  - Team stays on task with the 3 questions, divergences are addressed offline outside of this meeting:
    -  Visibility, clear understanding on a day-by-day basis
    - Product owners know the score on a daily basis
      - Can pull the plug at ANY time
- Ceremony #3: Sprint Review Meeting
  - Part 01: Product Demo
    - Led by Product Owner
  - Part 02: Sprint Retrospective
    - Led by Scrum Master
      - What worked?
      - What didn’t?
      - What adjustments can we make now?

### Scrum’s Three Artifacts
- Artifacts are VISUAL AIDS
- Artifact #1: Product Backlog
  - A list of features, prioritized by business value
  - Each feature has an associated estimate, provided by the ACTUAL team who will do the work
  - Backlog items come in from diverse sources, including the Team
- Artifact #2: Sprint Backlog
  - Topmost subset of the Product Backlog, loaded onto the Sprint’s “timebox”
  - Usually has more detail attached, including planned hours and primary person responsible to do the work during the Sprint
- Artifact #2: Sprint Backlog Sample
  - Is the list of work the Team is addressing during the current Sprint
- Artifact #3: Burndown Chart
  - Provides visibility into the Sprint
  - Illustrates progress by the team
  - Work on the Horizontal, Time on the Vertical
