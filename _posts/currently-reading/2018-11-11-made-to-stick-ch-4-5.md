### About the Book

Many of us struggle with how to communicate ideas effectively so that they make a difference.

This book tells you how to make our ideas stick, so that they are understood and have a lasting impact, changing the audienceâ€™s opinions or behaviour.

The first three chapters of this book are <a href="{{site.url}}/currently-reading/made-to-stick-ch-1-3/">here</a>.

### Chapter 4 - Concrete

- Abstraction is the luxury of the experts: when talking about their ideas, experts see the patterns and insights they have learned with years of practices. Yet, for novices these higher abstractions are out of reach, as the necessary foundations are missing.
- Presenting ideas in abstract ways makes them harder to remember and to coordinate with others, which might interpret the abstraction in other ways. Concreteness creates a shared "turf" on which people can collaborate, feeling comfortable they're all tackling the same challenge, helping our idea be both understandable and memorable.
- What make something "concrete"? If it's human-scale, meaning you can examine and understand it with your senses, it's concrete. For example:
  - Abstract distances we don't have a sense for, like the one between the earth and the sun, are much less effective than comparing the distance between Paris and Rome, or the distance between two opposites of a football field;
  - Abstract amounts and doses (e.g. the milligrams of a substance needed for healing an illness, or the desired size of an invention) is much less concrete than seeing these amounts in practices, or being able to touch them, as a prop;
  - Comparing abstract percentages (e.g. 20% of employees) is much more concrete by presenting these in a practical setting (e.g. 2 out of 11 football players...);
  - Teaching about abstract behaviours (e.g. discrimination) and skills (e.g. accounting) can be more effective by experiencing these first-hand.
- Concreteness is perhaps the easiest trait to add to our ideas; the barrier is simply forgetfulness: it's easy to forget we're talking like an expert, the curse of knowledge makes it feel unnatural to talk concretely about a topic we've known for years.

### Chapter 5 - Credible

- What makes people believe ideas? We believe because of experiences, faith and authorities; this means that, when trying to make people believe a new idea, we're fighting an uphill battle against a lifetime of convictions made by personal learning and social relationships.
- There are Four ways to weave credibility into our ideas:
  1. The first is authorities, reliable sources that can back up our ideas.
    - The first type of authority is an expert, the kind of person whose wall is covered in framed credentials.
    - The second type are celebrities and aspirational figures: we trust these people whom we want to be like.
    - When accessing the endorsement of the first two types is not viable, we can tap into the credibility of an anti-authority: sources that have a powerful connection to our core idea because of their personal story and, are having nothing to gain, are trusted because of their honesty and trustworthiness, not because of their status.
  2. A second way to is by making our claims more tangible and concrete, so that they can vouch for themselves, by adding  relevant details that support our core ideas, to make them seem more real and believable. Statistics work well, yet they are rarely helpful by themselves: statistics should be used to illustrate a relationship, as the relationship is more important to remember than the number, and to get our audience make up their mind on an issue. it's the human-scale and the context that makes them so.
  3. A third way doesn't rely neither nor authority nor numbers: proving with a concrete example we are clearly (over-)qualified for the job: "if you've made it there, you can make it anywhere".
  4. A fourth way is with testable credentials, claims that can be immediately verified by your audience ("see for yourself!").
- It's not always obvious which of these approaches we should use, so the key here is perseverance: we should try to mix and match these approaches, knowing when it's time to draw from a different well.
