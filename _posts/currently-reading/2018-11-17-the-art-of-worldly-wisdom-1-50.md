### About the book

Baltasar Gracián Y Morales (1601-1658) was born in Calatayud, Aragon, Spain. Some 300 aphorisms were extracted from Gracian’s works and published as "El Oráculo manual", or "The Art of Worldly Wisdom".

"Worldly" is apt because in many cases they reflect Gracian’s desire to instruct princes, and consequently display a certain deviousness and preoccupation with the exercise of power.

### About this summary

In the book the 300 short maxims do not have chapters or grouping; the book's format makes it perfect for reading a few of them at the time, with ample time for reflecting in between.

What lacks, is the possibility to use the book as a quick reference on certain topics. To improve on this, I am categorising the maxims.

- Frequency of Reference: how often I use these maxims:
  - Often
  - Occasionally
  - Barely
- Domains, the first principles of worldly wisdom:
  - Personal Graces:
    - Prudence: discerning the appropriate course of action for a given situation, at the appropriate time;
    - Courage: fortitude and the ability to confront fear and uncertainty;
    - Temperance: the practice of self-control, abstention, discretion and moderation;
    - Justice: wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty;
    - Knowledge: being well informed with tasteful learning and witticisms;
    - Tranquillity: living fully, being present and undisturbed by trifles;
    - Industry: being always employ'd in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.
    - Resolution: resolving to perform what you ought; performing without fail what is resolved;
  - Social Graces:
    - Appearances: to have worth, and to know how to show it, is to be worth double;
    - Friends: befriending intellectuals, cultivating friendships with teachers;
    - Relations: influencing, competing, having manners and etiquette.
