### About the book

Baltasar Gracián Y Morales (1601-1658) was born in Calatayud, Aragon, Spain. His works aimed at instructing princes and, consequently, display a certain deviousness and preoccupation with the exercise of power.

300 aphorisms were extracted from his works and published as "The Art of Worldly Wisdom", a manual for becoming wise "in the ways of the world".

### About this summary

The book has a curious format: the maxims are numbered and have a short title, but that’s about it; there are no chapters and no organisation by topic.

While this format makes the manual perfect for reading a few maxims at a time, it also makes it challenging to use it as a reference. Let’s say I want to reflect on a particular virtue, how do I find all the related maxims?

To help exactly with this kind of problem, I am sorting the maxims into the best categories I could think of! This post covers the first 50 maxims.

### Reading the Maxims

The book is widely available online in many translations, but my favourite is the one from 1992 by Christopher Maurer, which you can find here: [maxims 1-25](http://community.fortunecity.ws/roswell/vortex/401/library/aoww/aoww01.htm){:target="\_blank"}, [maxims 26-50](http://community.fortunecity.ws/roswell/vortex/401/library/aoww/aoww02.htm){:target="\_blank"}.

### Categorisation of the Maxims

The first two categories are quite easy:

- Number and Title: The position and title given to the maxims in the book;
- Frequency of Reference: how often I use these maxims, if you aren't sure about where to start, start reading the maxims from the "Often" category;

Picking the component virtues for worldly wisdom was quite challenging. In the end I settled on the two Domains, Personal and Social, and on a number of Graces for each domain, as follows:

- Personal Graces: how to be a worldly wise person:
  - Courage: fortitude and the ability to confront fear and uncertainty;
  - Industry: being always employ'd in something useful and cutting off all unnecessary actions;
  - Justice: wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty;
  - Knowledge: being well informed with tasteful learning and witticisms;
  - Judgement: discerning the appropriate course of action for a given situation, at the appropriate time;
  - Resolution: resolving to perform what you ought, performing without fail what is resolved;
  - Temperance: the practice of self-control, abstention, discretion and moderation;
  - Tranquillity: living fully, being present and undisturbed by trifles.
- Social Graces: how to act like a worldly wise person in the presence of others:
  - Appearances: to have worth, and to know how to show it, is to be worth double;
  - Friends: befriending intellectuals, cultivating friendships with teachers;
  - Relations: influencing, competing, having manners and etiquette.

Below are the first 50 maxims!
