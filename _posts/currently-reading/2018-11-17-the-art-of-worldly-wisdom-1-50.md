### About the book

Baltasar Gracián Y Morales (1601-1658) was born in Calatayud, Aragon, Spain. His works aimed at instructing princes and, consequently, display a certain deviousness and preoccupation with the exercise of power.

300 aphorisms were extracted from his works and published as "The Art of Worldly Wisdom", a manual for becoming wise "in the ways of the world".

### About this summary

The book has a curious format, the maxims are numbered and have a short title, but that's about it: there are no chapters and no organisation by topic.

In this format the manual is perfect for reading a few maxims at a time, but it also makes the book challenging to use as a reference. Let's say I want to reflect on a particular virtue, how do I find all the related maxims?

To help exactly with this kind of questions I am sorting the maxims into the best categories I could think of! This post covers the first 50 maxims.

### Reading the Maxims

You can read the first 50 maxims here: [1-25](http://community.fortunecity.ws/roswell/vortex/401/library/aoww/aoww01.htm){:target="\_blank"}, [26-50](http://community.fortunecity.ws/roswell/vortex/401/library/aoww/aoww02.htm){:target="\_blank"}.

### Categorisation of the Maxims

The first two categories are quite easy:

- Number and Title: The position and title given to the maxims in the book;
- Frequency of Reference: how often I use these maxims;

As worldly wisdom is not exactly easy to define, picking the categories was the hardest. In the end, I settled on the below Domains and Graces, the first principles of worldly wisdom:

  - Personal Graces:
    - Courage: fortitude and the ability to confront fear and uncertainty;
    - Industry: being always employ'd in something useful and cutting off all unnecessary actions;
    - Justice: wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty;
    - Knowledge: being well informed with tasteful learning and witticisms;
    - Prudence: discerning the appropriate course of action for a given situation, at the appropriate time;
    - Resolution: resolving to perform what you ought, performing without fail what is resolved;
    - Temperance: the practice of self-control, abstention, discretion and moderation;
    - Tranquillity: living fully, being present and undisturbed by trifles;
  - Social Graces:
    - Appearances: to have worth, and to know how to show it, is to be worth double;
    - Friends: befriending intellectuals, cultivating friendships with teachers;
    - Relations: influencing, competing, having manners and etiquette.
