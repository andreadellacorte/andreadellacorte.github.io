### About the book

Baltasar Graci치n Y Morales (1601-1658) was born in Calatayud, Aragon, Spain.

Graci치n wrote with a desire to instruct princes and, consequently, his works display a certain deviousness and preoccupation with the exercise of power: 300 aphorisms were extracted and published as "El Or치culo manual", or "The Art of Worldly Wisdom".

"The Art of Worldly Wisdom" is a manual for becoming Wordly prudent (wise), 300 short maxims without chapters in between, perfect for skimming and reading a few in moments of relaxation.

### About this summary

As there are no chapters or index, using the book as a reference in certain moments can be hard: you'll have to open the book and keep skimming until you find what you need.

To fix this I've decided to categorise all the 300 maxims in a series of 6 posts, 50 maxims at the time.

This post covers the first 50 maxims.

### Reading the Maxims

You can read the first 50 maxims here: [1-25](http://community.fortunecity.ws/roswell/vortex/401/library/aoww/aoww01.htm){:target="\_blank"}, [26-50](http://community.fortunecity.ws/roswell/vortex/401/library/aoww/aoww02.htm){:target="\_blank"}.

### Categorisation of the Maxims

Worldly wisdom is not exactly easy to define, so picking the categories was the hardest. After much tribulation, I've settled on the below categories:

- Number and Title: The position and title given to the maxims in the book;
- Frequency of Reference: namely, how often I use these maxims:
  - Often;
  - Occasionally;
  - Barely;
- Domains and Graces, the first principles of worldly wisdom (as identified by me):
  - Personal Graces:
    - Courage: fortitude and the ability to confront fear and uncertainty;
    - Industry: being always employ'd in something useful and cutting off all unnecessary actions;
    - Justice: wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty;
    - Knowledge: being well informed with tasteful learning and witticisms;
    - Prudence: discerning the appropriate course of action for a given situation, at the appropriate time;
    - Resolution: resolving to perform what you ought, performing without fail what is resolved;
    - Temperance: the practice of self-control, abstention, discretion and moderation;
    - Tranquillity: living fully, being present and undisturbed by trifles;
  - Social Graces:
    - Appearances: to have worth, and to know how to show it, is to be worth double;
    - Friends: befriending intellectuals, cultivating friendships with teachers;
    - Relations: influencing, competing, having manners and etiquette.
