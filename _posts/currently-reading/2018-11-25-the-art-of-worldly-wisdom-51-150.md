### About the book

Baltasar Gracián Y Morales (1601-1658) was born in Calatayud, Aragon, Spain. His works aimed at instructing princes and, consequently, display a certain deviousness and preoccupation with the exercise of power.

300 aphorisms were extracted from his works and published as "The Art of Worldly Wisdom", a manual for becoming wise "in the ways of the world".

### About this summary

The book has a curious format: the maxims are numbered and have a short title, but that’s about it; there are no chapters and no organisation by topic.

While this format makes the manual perfect for reading a few maxims at a time, it also makes it challenging to use it as a reference. Let’s say I want to reflect on a particular virtue, how do I find all the related maxims?

To help exactly with this kind of problem, I am sorting the maxims into the best categories I could think of! This post covers maxims 51 to 150.

The [previous post]({{site.url}}/currently-reading/the-art-of-worldly-wisdom-1-50/) covers 1 to 50.

### Reading the Maxims

The book is widely available online in many translations, but my favourite is the one from 1992 by Christopher Maurer, which you can find here: [maxims 51-75](http://community.fortunecity.ws/roswell/vortex/401/library/aoww/aoww03.htm){:target="\_blank"}, [maxims 76-100](http://community.fortunecity.ws/roswell/vortex/401/library/aoww/aoww04.htm){:target="\_blank", [maxims 101-125](http://community.fortunecity.ws/roswell/vortex/401/library/aoww/aoww05.htm){:target="\_blank"}}, [maxims 126-150](http://community.fortunecity.ws/roswell/vortex/401/library/aoww/aoww06.htm){:target="\_blank"}.

### Categorisation of the Maxims

The first two categories are quite easy:

- Number and Title: The position and title given to the maxims in the book;
- Frequency of Reference: how often I use these maxims, if you aren't sure about where to start, start reading the maxims from the "Often" category;

Picking the component virtues for worldly wisdom was quite challenging. In the end I settled on the two Domains, Personal and Social, and on a number of Graces for each domain, as follows:

- Personal Graces: how to be a worldly wise person:
  - Courage: fortitude and the ability to confront fear and uncertainty;
  - Industry: being always employ'd in something useful and cutting off all unnecessary actions;
  - Justice: wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty;
  - Knowledge: being well informed with tasteful learning and witticisms;
  - Judgement: discerning the appropriate course of action for a given situation, at the appropriate time;
  - Resolution: resolving to perform what you ought, performing without fail what is resolved;
  - Temperance: the practice of self-control, abstention, discretion and moderation;
  - Tranquillity: living fully, being present and undisturbed by trifles.
- Social Graces: how to act like a worldly wise person in the presence of others:
  - Appearances: to have worth, and to know how to show it, is to be worth double;
  - Friends: befriending intellectuals, cultivating friendships with teachers;
  - Relations: influencing, competing, having manners and etiquette.

  | 080 | Be careful when you inform yourself about things |  | Social | Relations |
  | 081 | Renew your brilliance |  |  |  |
  It is the privilege of the Phoenix. Excellence grows old and so does fame. Custom wears down our admiration, and a mediocre novelty can conquer the greatest eminence in its old age. So be reborn in courage, in intellect, in happiness, and in all else. Dare to renew your brilliance, dawning many
  times, like the sun, only changing your surroundings. Withhold it and make people miss it; renew it and make them applaud.
  | 082 | Neither all bad nor all good |  |  |  |
  A certain sage reduced the whole of wisdom to the golden mean. Carry right too far and it becomes wrong. The orange squeezed completely dry gives only bitterness. Even in enjoyment you shouldn't go to extremes. The intellect itself will go dry if pressed too hard, and if you milk a cow like a tyrant you will draw only blood.
  | 083 | Allow yourself some venial fault |  |  |  |
  An act of carelessness can sometimes be the best way to help others see your talents. Envy often ostracizes people : the more civil it is, the more criminal. It accuses what is very perfect of sinning by not sinning, and it condemns complete perfection. It makes itself into an Argos, looking for the faults in excellent things, if only to console itself. Like lightning, censure strikes the highest places. So let Homer nod at times, and pretend that your intelligence or courage -- though not your prudence -- has committed some act of carelessness. That way malevolence will calm down, and not burst its bubble of poison. This is like waving a red cape in front of the bull of envy in order to escape with immortality.
  | 084 | Know how to use your enemies |  |  |  |
  Grasp things not by the blade, which will harm you, but by the hilt, which will defend you. the same applies to emulation. The wise person finds enemies more useful than the fool does friends. Malevolence often levels the mountains of difficulty that favor made fearful. Many owe their greatness to their enemies. Flattery is fiercer than hatred, for hatred corrects the faults flattery had disguised. The prudent man makes a mirror out of the evil eye of others and it is more truthful than that of affection, and helps him reduce his defects or emend them. One grows very cautious when living across the border from malevolent rivals.
  | 085 | Don't be the wild card |  |  |  |
  [The wild card or joker : the one that can be anything its holder pleases.] Excellent things are easily abused. When everyone covets something, they are easily annoyed by it. It is a bad thing to be good for nothing, but worse to be good for everything. Some lose because they win so often, and soon they are as despised as they once were desired. Such wild cards are found in every sort of perfection. They lose their initial reputation for
  uniqueness, and are scorned as common. The remedy for extremes is not to exceed the golden mean in displaying your gifts. Be excessive in your perfection but moderate about showing it. The brighter the torch, the more it consumes itself and the less it lasts. To win true esteem, make yourself scarce.
  | 086 | Head off rumor |  |  |  |
  The crowd is a many-headed monster : many eyes for malice, many tongues for slander. Sometimes a rumor arises and blights the best reputation, and if it sticks to you like a nickname, your fame will perish. The crowd usually seizes on some outstanding weakness, or some
  ridiculous defect : fit material for its murmurings. At times it is our
  envious rivals who cunningly invent these defects. There are mean mouths and they ruin a great reputation sooner with a joke than with a shameless bold-faced lie. It is very easy to acquire a bad reputation, for badness is easily believed and hard to erase. Let the prudent person avoid all this, and keep an eye on vulgar insolence; for an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
  | 087 | Culture and refinement |  |  |  |
  Man is born a barbarian. Culture raises him above the beast. Culture turns us into true persons : the more culture, the greater the person. In that belief, Greece called the rest of the universe "barbarian." Ignorance is rough and rude. There is nothing more cultivating than knowledge. But wisdom herself is coarse when polish is lacking. Not only must understanding be refined, but also our desires and especially our conversation. Some people show a natural refinement both in their inner
  and outer gifts, their concepts and words, in their bodily adornment (which is like the bark) and their spiritual gifts (the fruit). Others are so gross that they tarnish everything, even their fine qualities, with an unbearable barbaric sloppiness.
  | 088 | Deal with others in a grand way |  |  |  |
  Aspire to elevation. The great should never be petty. You needn't go into all the details when conversing with others, especially when the subject is distasteful. Notice things, but do so casually; it isn't good to turn conversation into detailed interrogation. Act with a courteous, noble generality, which is a sort of gallantry. A large part of ruling lies in feigning indifference. Learn to overlook most of the things that happen among your close friends, your acquaintances, and especially your enemies. Overscrupulousness is irritating, and if it forms part of your character you will be tiresome to others. To keep circling around something unpleasant is a sort of mania. Remember that people usually behave ike what they are : according to their own heart and their own capacity.
  | 089 | Know yourself : your character, intellect, judgment, and emotions |  |  |  |
  You cannot master yourself if you do not understand yourself. There are mirrors for the face, but the only mirror for the spirit is wise self- reflection. And when you stop caring about your outer image, try to emend and improve the inner one. In order to undertake matters wisely, gauge your prudence and perspicacity. Judge how well you measure up to a challenge. Plumb your depths, weigh your resources.
  | 090 | The art of living long : live well |  |  |  |
  Two things bring life to an early end : stupidity and depravity. Some lose their life by not knowing how to save it; others, by not wanting to. Just as virtue is its own reward, vice is its own punishment. The person who races though a life of vice comes to a doubly quick end. The one who races
  through virtue never dies. The strength of the mind is communicated to the body. A good life is long both in intention and extension.
  | 091 | Never act unless you think it prudent to do so |  |  |  |
  If the person doing something suspects he will fail, it will be evident to the person watching, even more so when he is a rival. If your judgment
  wavers in the heat of emotion, you'll be thought a fool when things cool down. It is dangerous to undertake something when you doubt its wisdom. It would be safer not to act at all. Prudence refuses to deal in probability :
  it always walks under the midday sun of reason. How can something turn out well when caution started to condemn it the moment it was conceived? Even resolutions that passed the inner examination with no one dissenting often turn out badly; so what can we expect from those that reason
  doubted over and judgment considered rash?
  | 092 | Transcendent wisdom, in every situation |  |  |  |
  This is the first and highest rule in acting and speaking, the more
  necessary the greater and higher your occupation. An ounce of prudence is worth a pound of cleverness. It's more a matter of walking surely than of courting vulgar applause. A reputation for prudence is the ultimate triumph of fame. It is enough if you satisfy the prudent, whose approval is the touchstone of success.
  | 093 | A universal man |  |  |  |
  Possessing every perfection, he is equal to many men. He makes life ever so pleasant, communicating that enjoyment to his friends. Variety and perfection are what makes life delightful. It is a great art to know how to enjoy all good things. And since Nature made man a compendium of the whole natural world, let art make him a universe by training his taste and intellect.
  | 094 | Unfathomable gifts |  |  |  |
  The prudent person -- if he wants to be revered by others -- should never allow them to judge the extent of his knowledge and courage. Allow yourself to be known, but not comprehended. No one will discern the limits of your talent, and thus no one will be disappointed. You can win more admiration by keeping other people guessing the extent of your talent, or even doubting it, than you can by displaying it, however great.
  | 095 | Keep expectations alive |  |  |  |
  Keep nourishing them. Let much promise more, and let great deeds make people expect still greater ones. Don't show everything you have on the first roll of the dice. The trick is to moderate your strength and knowledge and advance little by little toward success.
  | 096 | Good common sense |  |  |  |
  It is the throne of reason, the foundation of prudence, and by its light it is easy to succeed. It is a gift from heaven, highly prized because it is first and best. Good sense is our armor, so necessary that the lack of this single piece will make people call us lacking. When least present, most missed. All actions in life depend on its influence, and all solicit its approval, for
  all depends on intelligence. It consists of a natural inclination to all that conforms most to reason, and to all that is most fit.
  | 097 | Make your reputation and keep it |  |  |  |
  We enjoy it on loan from Fame. It is expensive, for it is born from eminence, which is as rare as mediocrity is common. Once attained, it is easily kept. It confers many an obligation, performs many a deed. It is a sort of majesty when it turns into veneration, through the sublimity of its origin and sphere of action. Reputations based on substance are the ones that have always endured.
  | 098 | Write your intentions in cipher |  |  |  |
  The passions are the gates of the spirit. The most practical sort of knowledge lies in dissimulation. The person who shows his cards risks losing. Let caution and reserve combat the attentiveness of others. When your opponent sees into your reasoning like a lynx, conceal your thoughts like an inky cuttlefish. Let no one discover your inclinations, no one foresee them, either to contradict or to flatter them.
  | 099 | Reality and appearance |  |  |  |
  Things pass for what they seem, not for what they are. Only rarely do people look into them, and many are satisfied with appearances. It isn't enough to be right if your face looks malicious and wrong.
  | 100 | A man free of deceit and illusion |  |  |  |
  One who is virtuous and wise, a courtly philosopher. But do not be so only in appearance, or flaunt your virtue. Philosophy is no longer revered, although it is the chief pursuit of the wise. The science of prudence is no longer venerated. Seneca introduced it to Rome, and for a time it appealed to the noble. But now it is considered useless and bothersome. And yet freeing oneself from deceit has always been food for prudence, and one of the delights of righteousness.
