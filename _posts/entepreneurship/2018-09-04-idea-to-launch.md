### Step 1: Ideate

Goal: Pick an idea / 2 and validate if it is actually a problem worth solving.

- Kill your competition while solving the problem: don't build the product you want, build the product that your competitor will build.
- Create an idea list
- Pick an idea to validate
- Define the business metrics, effort to ROI ratio and pick an idea (or 2 really good ones)
- See what would be the product one would build if they have to compete us and succeed at it while solving the problem we are trying to solve. While doing so we need to apply what you documented above.

Idea List (ETA: Until Friday, 7th September) :

Rate that Meeting (need better name / product) - Andrea
A productivity tool that seamlessly integrates with G-Suite and Calendar to improve organizational productivity.

1 Line description of what we are our product tries to do: …  to be filled …

Thoughts:
We don’t want to solve the problems that Slack is already trying to solve in productivity. Our offering should be so unique that Slack cannot replicate easily.

 Challenges:
How do we measure productivity improvements tangibly?
What is the visible and invisible value seen by the customer.
If we cannot convince the customer of the value generated, we cannot generate revenue in a scalable way.

### Step 2: Socialize

Once we have an idea, we start socializing it.
Identify people who we think will use our end product and interview them.
Identify we are actually solving the problem we think we are or are there bigger problems which are more worthwhile to solve before we start working on the one we want to.
Go to step 1 if required and iterate.

### Step 3: MVP

Once we validate the idea we should chart a plan to build a working MVP in a agile way. This will help us iterate quickly and also give us key inputs regarding the initial roadmap.

We demo the product to the people we have interviewed in step 2. Listen to their feedbacks and iterate. At every step we need to be conscious of all key metrics we define in step 1.

### Step 4:  Launch

Once we have a MVP that is adopted by a few people we chart a launch plan with marketing and PR, and Customer acquisition strategy, pricing plans, roadmap and move forward and not look back.
