Notes from [Peter Rheinhart's How to Find Product Market Fit](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/13 ).

## Seeking Product Market Fit

1. Kill bad ideas fast
2. Stay lean to prolong your runway
3. Talk to customers
  - What problem do they have
  - Why haven't they solved it
  - Keep pitching and exploring separate
4. Iterate on the product
  - Don't shift audience and product one at the time
5. Start selling so you can find out the value of your product

## Achieving Product Market Fit

1. Category Leaders
  - Have built a platform other businesses can build their on (real platform = $100M revenue)
2. 3 x Bad Market Fit Examples
  - Hustling / bullying customers
  - Idle interest but no follow up
  - Trickle of customers
3. Good Market Fit
  - Immediate interest; all metrics moving
  - Sensation of market pulling more than you have
  - Starts small and evolves to solve adjacent problems
