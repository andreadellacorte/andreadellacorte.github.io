Notes from Peter Rheinhart's How to Find Product Market Fit:

## Seeking Product Market Fit

1. Kill bad ideas fast
2. Stay lean to prolong your runway
3. Talk to customers
  - What problem do they have
  - Why haven't they solved it
  - Separate pitching and exploring
4. Iterate on the product
  - Don't shift audience and product at the time
5. To find the true value of your product, start selling it

## Achieving Product Market Fit

1. Category Leaders
  - Have built a platform other businesses can build their on (real platform = $100M revenue)
2. Examples of Bad Market Fit
  - Hustling / bullying customers to use your product
  - Idle interest and no follow up
  - Trickle of customers coming in
3. Examples of Good Market Fit
  - Immediate interest; all metrics moving
  - Sensation of market pulling more than you have
  - Starts small and evolves to solve adjacent problems
