[Doc Rivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Rivers) ( Basketball)

* Pressure is a privilege _(what a way to shift our mindset – from stress to gratitude)_
* finish the race
* you will not be a victim
* ubuntu – I am because we are
* champions keep moving ahead

[Jill Ellis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Ellis) ( US women’s soccer team)

* not just about how you become the best, but stay the best. mountaintops are small and air is thin
* hold fast , stay true. Believe in yourself
* risk is opportunity
* be true to yourself
* if you want to be heard, make a statement _(references the equal pay protest)_

[Jose Mourinho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mourinho)

* understand your audience
* if you are prepared for the worst, you are prepared
* the underdog attack
* some rules are meant to be broken
* the train doesn’t stop twice
* **don’t coach the player, coach the team**. They already know how to play. Teach them how to play in that team _(my favorite)_

[Patrick Mouratoglou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mouratoglou) (tennis)

* your biggest weakness can be your greatest strength
* never be afraid to get fired
* mistakes are inevitable but don’t let them define you
* emotions are the worst adviser
* let them know they are not alone. _(Amazing story about why players tank their games even at the highest levels)_
* a good lie can become the truth _(how a lie helped Serena Williams during the Wimbledon)_
* everything depends on you

[Dawn Staley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_Staley) (basketball)

* bring your own ball
* growth takes place outside of the comfort zone
* create a home court advantage _( build a community of supporters/fans)_
* when you make someone feel better, they want to help you succeed
* 24 hrs rule- move on from a win or loss in 24 hrs _(I loved this – can sure be mantra for our lives too)_
* **what is delayed is not denied**. It will happen.
