[From the Commencement Address at the American University in Beirut by Nassim Nicholas Taleb](http://fooledbyrandomness.com/AUBCommencement.pdf)

The following are no-nos:

* Muscles without strength,
* friendship without trust,
* opinion without risk,
* change without aesthetics,
* age without values,
* food without nourishment,
* power without fairness,
* facts without rigor,
* degrees without erudition,
* militarism without fortitude,
* progress without civilization,
* complication without depth,
* fluency without content,
* and, most of all, religion without tolerance.
