My recommended approach to learning languages, which worked well for Turkish for me.

### Background

I struggled with Turkish on and off for a couple years. I never took classes, but used Duolingo and Memrise extensively. The benefits were limited. Yet, I finally figured out a better approach which has beared good results.

### Approach

The approach is simple. Every day you study:
  1. Grammar: Complete three [Language Transfer - Introduction to Turkish](https://www.languagetransfer.org/introduction-to-turkish) podcast episodes
  2. Vocabulary: Learn 15-30 words via spaced repetitions, for example here [Turkish 1000 Words](https://www.memrise.com/course/557/turkish-1000-words/)

If you keep this up, you should complete the podcasts in 15 days and memorise roughly 225 - 450 words in just two weeks. At this point, it's time to get serious and find a local to talk to.

The easiest way for me was to find one of the well-reviewed teachers on [iTalki](http://italki.com/) and sign up for 30 minutes lessons twice a week.

### Did this work for you?

Yes, Language Transfer got Turkish to click in my brain quicker than years or Memrise or Duolingo could. Given the way Turkish is (highly predictable), having got some strong grammar basis I can now continue learning path by build vocabulary and talking to my teacher as often as I can.

### Notes

In the Language Transfer Podcast it's fundamental you don't just listen: you need to stop the recording each time a question is asked and answer it yourself, not just listen for the student answering them, or you'll learn nothing.

If you are on Android, I recommend [Podcast Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict) for keeping the Language Transfer podcasts with you.

This approach can be easily ported to other languages since the resources I'm linking are available in a number of others as well.

### Conclusion

I hope this approach helps you learn any language you may desire!
