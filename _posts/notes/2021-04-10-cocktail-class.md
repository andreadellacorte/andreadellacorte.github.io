List of recipes covered in Gustavo's birthday cocktail class.

### But First...

4 things are very important in making cocktails:

1. Balance - no flavour should stand up too much, though a lot here depends on preferences
2. Temperature - coldest drink possible, made in the shortest time possible; if you can, big cubes of ice retain flavour for longer, also: freeze your glasses!
3. Dilution - water is the glue that binds the ingredients together - usually directly inverse to the coldness of ice
4. Always use fresh ingredients

### Daiquiri

This is the drink you should ask for when you go to a bar to figure out if it's a good place or not.

- 2oz Rum (White Preferable)
- 1oz Lime Juice
- 1/2oz Caster Sugar (1 Tablespoon)

Shake with ice and strain into cocktail glass. No Garnish.

### Mojito

- 2oz Rum (White Preferable)
- 1 Lime
- 1/2oz Caster Sugar (1 Tablespoon)
- 7-8 Mint Leaves

Cut lime into 4 segments and put straight into bottom of tall glass. Add the sugar to the lime wedges and then muddle gently to extract the juice and essential oils. Take your mint leaves and ‘clap’ them to release aroma before adding to glass. Then you can add the rum. Fill your glass 3/4 with ice before churning by lifting mint and limes through the glass until you’ve added dilution and dropped the temperature. Top glass with ice and add a small splash of soda before garnishing with a mint bouquet for aroma.

### Dark ‘n’ Stormy/Cuba Libre

- Half Lime squeezed
- 2oz Rum (Dark preferably)
- 6oz Ginger Beer/Coke

Build drink in glass then fill with ice and garnish with squeezed half lime husk.

### Dark ‘n’ Stormy (Homemade)

- 2oz Dark Rum
- 1oz Lime Juice
- 1/2oz Rich Simple Syrup
- 1 inch Ginger

Make the Rich Simple Syrup - in a pan on a low heat combine 2 parts sugar with 1 part boiling water and stir to dissolve. Bottle once cooled and keep in the fridge ready for the class. Measure accurately and please make with care - this allows me to know exactly what your drinks taste like so I can help you make adjustments.

In the base of a shaking tin muddle 1 inch of peeled and chopped ginger before adding the remaining ingredients. Shake with ice and then fine strain into a tall glass over ice and top with soda. Garnish with lime husk and add dash of optional bitters. 

### Old Cuban

- 1.5oz Rum
- 3/4oz Lime Juice
- 2/3 Tablespoon Caster Sugar
- 6/7 Mint Leaves / 3 Strawberries
- 2oz Sparkling Wine

Shake above ingredients with ice before fine straining into a chilled cocktail glass. Top with 2oz of sparkling wine and garnish with a mint leaf/strawberry.
