This is a playbook on everything Andrea. It captures more about me and how I operate in a working environment.

### 🏠 OVERVIEW

- [ENFJ-A](https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-personality) - Extraverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judging personality traits. Warm, forthright, love helping others.

### 👍🏼 STRENGTHS

- Both Barrel and Ammunition (see [[Barrels and Ammunitions]]): Love taking initiative, organising and pointing people in the right direction, but not afraid to get my hands dirty and put in the work.
- Dependable: Very high 'say-do' ratio.

### 👎🏼 WEAKNESSES

- Operating without context: I struggle contributing to decisions where I don’t have sufficient context or background.
- Going too fast: Sometimes I can jump into things too fast and skip a few steps in my communication. While I do my best to explain the "why" of what I'm doing don't be afraid to rein me in.

### 🛠 PRINCIPLES

- Leave it better than you found it: What I do should have a positive impact on society, my family, myself.
- This too shall pass: Some periods are ups, some periods are down. Be modest in the highs, bear and learn during the lows.
 
### 📚 FAVORITE BOOKS

- The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger, by Stephen King
- How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big, by Scott Adams
- A Little Life, by Hanya Yanagihara
- 1984, by George Orwell

### 🙏🏼 FAVORITE QUOTE

<blockquote>Those who say it cannot be done should not get in the way of those who are doing it. — Bernard Shaw</blockquote>
