These are my notes from the excellent [Applications of Everyday Leadership](https://www.coursera.org/learn/everyday-leadership-application/home/info) course from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

## Introduction

This guidance covers how performance management system can be designed by leaders – including the four dimensions (what, who, when, and how) of high-quality and timely information – to collect useful information about performance, and how that information can be used by everyday leaders to provide feedback and coaching that is appropriately influential.

## What

The feedback should be relevant, informative and not subjective. Collecting information about what a job entails (Job Analysis) can help reduce irrelevant feedback. Using examples of behaviour (Behavioral Anchoring) can help calibrate understanding and make the feedback less subjective.

## Who

Feedback should be triangulated by multiple perspectives to be comprehensive and unbiased; we can achieve this by getting others (co-workers, customers) involved and adding a self-evaluation component to provide a prospective of fairness.

## When

Time is a very important dimension in performance management. Collection of information should occur throughout the performance period, meaning final evaluation is based on performance and not recent memory. Delivery of information should occur throughout the performance period, to help with mid-course corrections of performance, better for the employee AND better for the company.

## How

Leaders need courage to use the information gathered productively, for example by confronting conflicts (e.g. poor performers). Leaders can foster courage through accountability, and should be open to evaluating even their own capabilities.
