Culture is defined as commonly held ideas, beliefs and practices within a collective, and it's one of the most critical and dynamic elements of organisational design.

Having a strong culture ensures that employees within a certain organization have a sense of unity and something in common. This makes company culture a major influencer on an employee's decision to choose one organization over another.

More specifically, culture is the personality or character of an organization; this character is created by everything an organization has learned in its history, while dealing with  external challenges and internally how we relate to each other.

### Shaping and Reinforcing Culture

A company culture shapes its personality, and it realizes in the form of set of rules and regulations as well in employees' behavior and way of work.

Culture is highly impacted by the values defined by the company, but it's not just about what the firm says it "values", but also about by what management focuses on, which in turn defines what's expected of its employees.

Management can shape and reinforce culture by defining:

- Decision making practices that shape managerial attention;
- Organizational reaction in time of crisis;
- Evaluation criteria and practices for allocating rewards;
- Hiring, promotion, and management development practices.
