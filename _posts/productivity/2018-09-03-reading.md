I am a long time subscriber of [Hacker News Digest](https://www.hndigest.com/): I skim the articles' titles 2 or 3 times a day, pick the most interesting and track them on [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/).

For keeping myself up to date on world news I read the [Economist Espresso](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.darwin). I also like [theSkimm](https://theskimm.com/?r=e24baba2), which is a lot more progressive but very focused on the USA so less interesting now that I live in the UK.
