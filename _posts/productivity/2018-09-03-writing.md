This blog is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) via [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/); Jekyll made it really easy to organise my blog the way I wanted it, automating many small tasks that save me a lot of time.

For the CSS I used a theme called [ReMarkdown](https://fvsch.github.io/remarkdown/).

All typing is done via [Atom Beta](https://atom.io/beta); pushing content to the remote repository is done via command line on [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) or UI via [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
