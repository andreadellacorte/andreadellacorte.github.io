### Scrum
- 3 Roles
- 3 Ceremonies
- 3 Artifacts

### Scrum’s Three Roles

1. The Product Owner:
  - Defines and Prioritizes Features
  - Owns the gathering of requirements
  - Agrees to Iteration Ground Rules
  - Set length of calendar time for Sprint
    - (2,3,4 weeks typical)
  - Does not interfere with Sprint (no scope creep)
  - Can pull the plug at any time (has the power)
  - Honors rules and the Scrum process during Sprints
2. Scrum Master: A Boundary Manager
  - Supports the Team
  - Facilitates the Daily Scrum meeting. Asks each developer:
    - What did you do yesterday?
    - What are you doing today?
    - What is in your way?
  - Listens and watches carefully during Scrum meeting
    - Pays careful attention to non-verbal cues
    - Removes Impediments in Way of Team
  - Secures resources (monitors, rooms, etc)
  - Communicates to Product Owner
3. The Team:
  - Participates in design
    - To gain understanding of problem/solution space
  - Selects subset of prioritized Product Backlog for Sprint commitment
    - Estimates the effort
    - Fills the timebox with work
    - Commits to the work as a team
  - Self organizes:
    - Everyone commits to ALL TASKS necessary during the Sprint
    - Determines the nature of self-organization
  - Teams select work for each Sprint
    - Teams self-organize
    - Teams have a ‘velocity’

### Scrum’s Three Ceremonies
1. Sprint Planning Meeting
  - Product Owner reviews:
    - Vision, Roadmap, Release Plan
  - Team reviews:
    - Estimates for each item on Backlog that is a candidate for the Sprint
    - Team pulls the work:
      - From the Product Backlog onto the Sprint Backlog
2. The Daily Scrum
  - By and for the Team
  - Other may attend and NOT speak
  - Team members speak, others listen
  - Team stays on task with the 3 questions, divergences are addressed offline outside of this meeting:
    -  Visibility, clear understanding on a day-by-day basis
    - Product owners know the score on a daily basis
      - Can pull the plug at ANY time
3. Sprint Review Meeting
  - Part 01: Product Demo
    - Led by Product Owner
  - Part 02: Sprint Retrospective
    - Led by Scrum Master
      - What worked?
      - What didn’t?
      - What adjustments can we make now?

### Scrum’s Three Artifacts
1. Product Backlog
  - A list of features, prioritized by business value
  - Each feature has an associated estimate, provided by the ACTUAL team who will do the work
  - Backlog items come in from diverse sources, including the Team
2. Sprint Backlog
  - Topmost subset of the Product Backlog, loaded onto the Sprint’s “timebox”
  - Usually has more detail attached, including planned hours and primary person responsible to do the work during the Sprint
3. Increment
  - The sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints.
