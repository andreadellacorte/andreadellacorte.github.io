SOLID are five basic principles which help create good software architecture. SOLID is an acronym where:

- S stands for Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should take care of only one responsibility;
- O stands for Open Closed Principle (OCP): Extension should be preferred over modification;
- L stands for Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): A parent class object should be able to refer child objects seamlessly during runtime polymorphism;
- I stands for Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Client should not be forced to use an interface if it does not need it;
- D stands for Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High level modules should not depend on low level modules but should depend on abstraction.
