title: Signs I'm OK

The symptoms I am not burned out and things are going overall OK (i.e., nothing catastrophic is currently happening).

Writing these down so I can recognize when I need a mental health day (or more).

1. I have a solid routine going
2. I listen to music and podcasts
3. I enjoy talking about what is going on
4. I am organized and have spare time / energy to work through my personal TODOs
5. I experience surges of creativity, coming up with novel ideas for things to do or ways to do things
6. I spend quiet time on hobbies and other non-directed activities
7. I use a lot less social media and get out of bed early
8. I take care of myself; I drink lots of water, exercise, take walks
