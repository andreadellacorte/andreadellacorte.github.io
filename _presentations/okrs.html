Picking the right goal setting mechanism can

OKRs are the most powerful because they're department
critical thinking framework and part ongoing discipline

Long term success relies on every team member clearly understanding
what matters on long term priorities

They help teams and individuals

- Manage priorities
- Think big pictures
- Fail smart and fail fast

OKR is made of a single Objective and 3 to 5 Key Results

Objectives are a qualititative, aspirational statement meant to inspire action
  - Where you want to go, meant to move the organization fast toward it
  - Objectives are always followed by "as measure by"

  - Propel an organization forward
  - Communicate what's most Important
  - Set quarterly, semiannually, or annually

  - Example from google - Make browsing as fast as flipping a magazine

Key Results
  - The quantitative targets used to measure the success of the objective

  - Example from google - Reduce pageload by 1.5seconds

  ## 1. Identify the problem
]
.right-column[
An issue or something preventing growth, change, or a desired outcome

What do I want to change? What is holding me back from building my best scenario?

The easiest way to start here, is to gather all problems (not difficult!)
not matter how small

The problems should then be prioritized; what is urgent
and important?
]

---
layout: false
.left-column[
  ## 2. Turn the problem into an objective
]
.right-column[
The easiest way to do this is by asking "so what"? This helps align not on
what the problem is, but also on why the problem is worth solving

Problem statement

"Attrition is too high. We are losing some of our best talent."

Objective

"Attract and retain the best talent in our industry."

A problem worth solving and a clearly valuable objective, that all functions
and departments wants to solve and knows why they matter.

Achieving 70% is a great success. There is research people achieve more when
the goal-post is set high. The key result are the goal post and finish line,
not the plan to get there.?

## OKR design process for a group
.footnote[the more buy-in the better]

---
layout: false
.left-column[
  ## When can I apply them?

.right-column[

]
Bringing the team in as soon as possible; making powerful OKRs required a
hybrid both top-down and bottom-up thinking

- Objectives are usually set by leadership
- Key Results are instead defined by subject matter experts

While this approach can be used at the team level, let's use an example for a
company OKR.

---

1. Leadership sets the Objective, picking a goal focusing on a specific direction

---

2. Executive sponsor communicates the objectives, ideally in a facilitated live discussion

3. Team sets 3 - 5 Key Results

This is different by a totally top-down approach

.left-column[

4. Key Results owners are then chosen amongst the most appropriate people, the
one that are the most likely to be able to influence the objective

---

5. Define the tactics - Tasks involved, when they need to be completed,
 who will need to be involved - the group that will help progress the key
 result and engage leadership when the KR or objective is at risk

For the 5 steps to work, it's essential to have a dedicated leader
connect the dot, understand and advocate for the bigger picture

OKRs are about progress, not perfection - having people in a room discussing,
and advocating for what matters for them is already valuable

## Managing and following up on OKRs
.footnote[from wishes to proven results]

---
layout: false
.left-column[
  ## When can I apply them?
]
.right-column[

]
Teams often forget to manage their OKRs

1. Set a cadence to review OKRs (monthly, quarterly)

Most success is 6 months OKRs, with bi-monthly check-ins; monthly check-in
work well to manage the OKRs on a monthly basis.

Prefer more frequently in the beginning.

2. Establish single source of truth

Make reporting painless for leadership; assign a project manager to supporte
the exec leader - PM is responsible for defining a plan, task list and communicate
work

3. Set predetermined milestones

Milestones (intermediate KR) are made by the KR owner, and
should be included in the tactical plan

While having structure at the top helps, it's better to let the organizations
define the system that works for them
