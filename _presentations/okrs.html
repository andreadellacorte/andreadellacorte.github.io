OKRs are a strategic framework to communicate top priorities, which can help you OKRs move an organization together in the same direction, and

- Enable focus on what matters most

OKRs are amongst the most powerful because they're department critical thinking framework and part ongoing discipline.

The long-term success of a company relies on every team member clearly being able to understand what matters most

OKRs help teams and individuals

**Objectives**

- The qualititative, aspirational statement meant to inspire action

  - Where you want to go, meant to move the organization fast toward it

  - Objectives are always followed by "as measure by"

They
  - Propel an organization forward

  - Communicate what's most Important

  - Set quarterly, semiannually, or annually

_Example from Google: Make browsing as fast as flipping a magazine_

OKRs are made of a single Objective and 3 to 5 Key Results.

  ## 1. Identify the problem
]
.right-column[
An issue or something preventing growth, change, or a desired outcome

What do I want to change? What is holding me back from building my best scenario?

The easiest way to start here, is to gather all problems (not difficult!)
not matter how small

The problems should then be prioritized; what is urgent
and important?
]

---
layout: false
.left-column[
  ## 1. Identify the problem
  ## 2. Turn the problem into an objective
]
.right-column[
The easiest way to do this is by asking "so what"? This helps align not on
what the problem is, but also on why the problem is worth solving.

_Example: "Attrition is too high. We are losing some of our best talent."_

becomes

_Objective: "Attract and retain the best talent in our industry."_

A problem worth solving and a clearly valuable objective, that all functions and departments wants to solve and know why it matters.

## OKR design process for a group
.footnote[the more buy-in the better]

???

Bringing the team in as soon as possible; making powerful OKRs required a
hybrid both top-down and bottom-up thinking

- Objectives are usually set by leadership
- Key Results are instead defined by subject matter experts

While this approach can be used at the team level, let's use an example for a company OKR.

---
layout: false
.left-column[
  ## 1. Set the Objective
]
.right-column[
  The first step is to set a goal that can focus an organization or team in one direction. This is usually done by a leader or the executive group.
]

---
layout: false
.left-column[
  ## 1. Set the Objective
  ## 2. Assign a sponsor & communicate
]
.right-column[
  An (executive) sponsor is usually assigned to each OKR; they are the people that will communicate what the objective is about and answer questions.

  This usually happens during a live Q & A meeting, which helps all people involved get on the same page.
]

---
layout: false
.left-column[
  ## 1. Set the Objective
  ## 2. Assign a sponsor & communicate
  ## 3. Set 3 - 5 Key Results
]
.right-column[
  In this case the team or SMEs define the Key Results that will contribute to achieving the objective.

  This step is what makes it non top-down approach, but a mix of top-down and bottom-up.
]

---
layout: false
.left-column[
  ## 1. Set the Objective
  ## 2. Assign a sponsor & communicate
  ## 3. Set 3 - 5 Key Results
  ## 4. Assign KR Owners
]
.right-column[
  Each KR has a responsible owner, chosen amongst the people that are the most likely to be able to influence the objective.
]

---
layout: false
.left-column[
  ## 1. Set the Objective
  ## 2. Assign a sponsor & communicate
  ## 3. Set 3 - 5 Key Results
  ## 4. Assign KR Owners
  ## 5. Define the tactics
]
.right-column[
Who (or what group) will shepherd the key result through

Tasks involved, when they need to be completed

Who will need to be involved for the tasks to be done

Who will engage leadership when the KR or objective is at risk

---

For these 5 steps to work, it's essential to have a dedicated leader
connect the dot, understand and advocate for the bigger picture

OKRs are about progress, not perfection - having people in a room discussing, and advocating for what matters for them is already valuable.

## Tips & Tricks in Managing OKRs
.footnote[from wishes to proven results]

- - -

Strategy is great, but strategy without a process, is little more than a wishlist

Number 1 mistake in managing OKRs: set it and forget it

---
layout: false
.left-column[
  ## 1. Set a cadence
]
.right-column[
Make sure to review OKRs - Monthly, quarterly.

Most success is 6 months OKRs, with bi-monthly check-ins; monthly check-in
work well to manage the OKRs on a monthly basis.

Prefer more frequently in the beginning.
]

---
layout: false
.left-column[
  ## 1. Set a cadence
  ## 2. Establish single source of truth
]
.right-column[
  Make reporting painless for leadership.

  Assigning a project manager to partner with the exec leader is critical.

  The PM is responsible for managing the KR from the single source of truth, which defines the tactics, tracking the task list, communicating what work is ongoing and complete and keeping the KR up to date.

  Project Manager should start every meeting with a review of the OKR source of truth. If you have a weekly meeting, the #1 agenda should be reviewing the OKRs.
]

---
layout: false
  .left-column[
  ## 1. Set a cadence
  ## 2. Establish single source of truth
  ## 3. Set predetermined milestones
]
.right-column[
  Milestones (intermediate KR) are made by the KR owner, should be pre-determined before the start of the period and documented in the tactical plan.

  Example: If KR is achieve $120,000 in sales in Q1, you could monthly targets to achieve $40,000 sales each month.

.left-column[
  ## 1. Set a cadence

  ## 4. Trust your leaders

.right-column[
  Reporting and communication benefit from having structure at the top, but don't overdo it.


  Most OKRs implementation see benefit in letting organizations define the mechanisms and systems that works for them.

  That way you'll have an engaged organization that wants to deliver on the shared objectives.

OKRs should connect to your long-term strategy; a living document that should explain your mission, what the industry and market trends are, and how your business will evolve.

This document will help explain why OKRs matter, tying them to long term vision statement.

## OKR Design Checklist

---

✅ The Objective inspires me.

✅ There are three-five Key Results (KRs).

✅ The OKR is written in basic language a team member from any department
could understand and is free of acronyms.

✅ The OKR doesn’t feel like a task list or “business as usual.”

✅ The OKR drives value more than activities.

✅ Each KR includes a number.

✅ Each KR is measurable and specific — progress made against it couldn’t be debated.

✅ Progress could be made on each KR approximately every two weeks.

✅ All targets are aspirational + assume 70% = achievement.

✅ Assuming all KRs are met, the Objective is then also achieved
