<p>My name is Andrea and I live in London.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in Southern Italy and, before the UK, I've lived in the Netherlands, Canada and USA.</p>

<p>I like managing software projects, reading about tech, travelling, thinking about life's bigger meanings and playing videogames (when I have time).</p>

<p>I <3 my wife, kid and dog.</p>

<p>I am a MEng in Software Engineering graduate from the University of Salerno and work at <a href="https://www.improbable.io">Improbable.io</a> as Principal Technical Delivery Manager.</p>

<p>I used to practice boxing and other martial arts, but my knee isn't what it used to be, so now I am into rowing (3000m in 11m46s). I also like swimming (500m in 13m53s) and taking long walks with my doggy.</p>

<p>I write about things I learn during my day from others, books or just my experiences.</p>
