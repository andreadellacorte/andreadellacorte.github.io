<p>I like managing software projects, reading about tech, traveling, thinking about life's bigger meanings and playing videogames.</p>

<p>I <3 my wife, kid and dog.</p>

<p>I am a MEng in Software Engineering graduate from the University of Salerno and work at <a href="https://www.improbable.io">Improbable.io</a> as Principal Technical Delivery Manager.</p>

<p>I used to practice boxing and other martial arts but my knee isn't what it used to be, so now I am like rowing and taking long walks with my doggy.</p>

<p>I write about things I learn during my day from others, books or just my experiences.</p>
