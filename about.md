My name is Andrea.

I was born and raised in Southern Italy and, before the UK, I've lived in the Netherlands, Canada and USA.

I like managing software projects, reading, travelling and playing videogames (time permitting).

I ❤️ my wife, kid and dog.

I have a background in Software Engineering and work at [Improbable](https://improbable.io) as Head of Program Management in the Games Tech Unit.

I used to practice boxing and other martial arts, but my knee isn't what it used to be, so now I am into rowing (3000m in 11m46s). I also like swimming (500m in 13m53s) and taking long walks with my doggy.

My personality type is [ENFJ](https://www.personalitypage.com/html/ENFJ.html).

I write about things I learn during my day from others, books or just my experiences.
