My name is Andrea and I live in London.

I was born and raised in Southern Italy and, before the UK, I've lived in the Netherlands, Canada and USA.

I like managing software projects, reading, travelling, wondering about life and playing videogames (time permitting).

I <3 my wife, kid and dog.

I am a MEng in Software Engineering graduate from the University of Salerno and work at [Improbable](https://www.improbable.io) as [Technical Delivery Manager](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1091954131/).

I used to practice boxing and other martial arts, but my knee isn't what it used to be, so now I am into rowing (3000m in 11m46s). I also like swimming (500m in 13m53s) and taking long walks with my doggy.

My personality type is [ENFJ](https://www.personalitypage.com/html/ENFJ.html).

I write about things I learn during my day from others, books or just my experiences.
