<h2>About Me</h2>

<center><img src="/img/andreadellacorte.jpg"></center>

My name is Andrea and I live in London, UK.

I like managing projects, reading about tech and playing videogames, all while keeping my wife, kid and dog happy.</p>

I write about things I learn during my day, from others, books or just my experiences.
