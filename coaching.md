Are you preparing for an interview with Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc? Are you bored of practicing from Cracking the Coding Interview all alone? I can help!

In my time at Amazon out of their Seattle and London offices as Software Developer Engineer and Technical Program Manager,  I've conducted over 50+ SDE interviews and over 100+ TPM interviews, covering all kind of topics, like Behavioural, System Design and Coding :)

Additionally, I've worked with nonprofits like [Code Your Future]() and mentored / coached over 30+ folks on topics like career development, interviewing and general life skills.

If you'd like to improve your success chances book a session below or get in touch with me directly at [andrea@dellacorte.me](mailto:andrea@dellacorte.me)!
