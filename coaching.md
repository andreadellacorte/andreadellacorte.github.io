This is a standing invitation: if we have [common interests](/), I want to talk to you.

My email address is [andrea@dellacorte.me](mailto:andrea@dellacorte.me).

- I love discussing stuff via email. Email works best for me as I'm not on social network nowadays, but sort through my mail many times a day. Additionally, writing helps me organise my mind and reshape my thinking. I promise I'll read 100% of your emails and get back to 90%+ of your emails.

- I love reading suggestions. If you see something on the internet worth discussing, send it over. Good content is priceless - I have a huge [library of unread ideas](https://fs.blog/2013/06/the-antilibrary/) I jump hectically around.

- I love making friends. If you live in London or you're just visiting for a while, let's meet up for coffee in the city, my treat.

- I love hearing about ways to make an impact. If you know of charities who'd benefit by mentoring, coaching, career guidance, hit me up. Same as you'd like me to help you out with one of your challenges.
